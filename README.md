Research Project Overview: A program to address the following request—
I’m trying to test if high school students can remember drawings better than words. I’m replicating Experiment 1A in “The drawing effect: Evidence for reliable and robust memory benefits in free recall.” In the experiment, the researchers created two programs using software that is not available to me but explain how each program functions. I need to replicate these programs as closely as possible.
